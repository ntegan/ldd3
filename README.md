# Linux Device Drivers Book 3rd Edition
> My notes and examples

This project can use my `hello_modules` project  
to compile a kernel, leaving a source tree  
available for out-of-tree module compilation.  
The compiled modules can then be added to the initramfs  
from that project, for testing in the QEMU emulator.
